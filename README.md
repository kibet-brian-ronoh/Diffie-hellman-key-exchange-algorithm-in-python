# Diffie-hellman-key-exchange-algorithm-in-python
Simple demonstration of Diffie Hellman Key Exchange algorithm. 

Setup and Execution:
1. Install Python 3+
2. Run from Terminal

Run Through
1. The program calculates the first 10,000 prime numbers and puts them into a list.
2. Pseudo-randomly selects two values for g and p (guaranteed not the same values).
3. Then asks the user for two integer inputs for the values of a and b.
4. Computes each step of Diffie-Hellman
5. Checks if the final keys are equal (which it should be)
